## Investigation üîç

### Find the Murderer ü¶π

#### 1. We will check the `crime_scene_report` on the murder committed date

```SQL
SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder' and date = 20180115 and Lower(city) = 'sql city';
```
| Date       | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                | City     |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 2018-01-15 | Murder | Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave". | SQL City |

We got the details of witnesses for the murder. Let's find out their interview reports

#### 2. Find the interview reports of both witnesses

```SQL
SELECT * FROM interview
WHERE person_id = (
  SELECT id from person
  WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
  ORDER BY address_number DESC limit 1
) OR person_id = (
	SELECT id from person
	WHERE Lower(name) LIKE '%Annabel%'AND
  	address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
);
```

| Person ID | Transcript                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 14887     | I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W". |
| 16371     | I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January 9th.                                                    |

Now that we have the witness reports, we can go ahead and find the murderer

#### 3. Find the murderer

```SQL
SELECT p.name
FROM get_fit_now_check_in c
JOIN get_fit_now_member m
	ON c.membership_id = m.id
JOIN person p
	ON m.person_id = p.id
JOIN drivers_license dl
	ON p.license_id = dl.id
WHERE
	m.membership_status = 'gold'AND
	m.id LIKE '48Z%' AND
	c.check_in_date = '20180109' AND
	dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
LIMIT 1
;
```

| Jeremy Bowers |

üéâ There we go, we got the murderer!! You will see this message upon submitting the murderer's name.

| value |
|------------|
| Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer. |

### Find the person behind the murder üß†

Now that we found the murderer, let's find the person who paid for the murder. Let's see his interview report for that.

```SQL
SELECT * from interview
WHERE person_id = (
  SELECT p.id
  FROM get_fit_now_check_in c
  JOIN get_fit_now_member m
  ON c.membership_id = m.id
  JOIN person p ON m.person_id = p.id
  JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
  WHERE
	  m.membership_status = 'gold'AND
	  m.id LIKE '48Z%' AND
	  c.check_in_date = '20180109' AND
	  dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
  LIMIT 1
);
```
